They are constantly connected to work emails, group chats and social media notifications. As a reaction to this, some people are turning to the slow living movement.\n\nSlow living does not mean doing everything in slow motion. Instead, it is about making conscious choices and refusing to rush through every moment. For example, some followers of the movement decide to limit their screen time, cook their meals from scratch, or walk to work instead of taking the fastest transport.\n\nCritics argue that slow living is a privilege. They point out that only people with flexible jobs and enough money can really choose to work less or live outside big cities. However, supporters answer that slow living is not only for the rich. According to them, anyone can adopt small changes, such as turning off their phone during dinner or planning one ‘unplugged’ afternoon per week.\n\nAlthough it may not solve all the problems of modern life, the movement invites people to question whether ‘busy’ always means ‘successful’.\nQuestion: What is the main purpose of the text?",

Paragraph A: In recent years, many educators have suggested that community service should become part of school exams. They argue that helping in local projects – such as cleaning parks or visiting elderly people – teaches students empathy and responsibility. According to them, these qualities are just as important as mathematical or linguistic skills, and schools have a duty to encourage them.\n\nParagraph B: Opponents of this idea are worried about adding even more pressure to students’ lives. Young people already face heavy workloads and high expectations from parents and teachers. If volunteering becomes a requirement for passing exams, they fear that students will see it as just another obligation, not as a meaningful experience. In their view, community service should remain voluntary.\n\nParagraph C: Another concern is fairness. Some students live in areas where it is easy to find volunteering opportunities; others do not. In addition, not every teenager has the same amount of free time. Those who have to work after school or take care of younger siblings may not be able to complete the same number of hours as their classmates. Critics worry that mandatory community service could increase existing inequalities.\n\nParagraph D: A possible compromise is to include community service as an optional part of the assessment. For example, students who participate in approved projects could receive extra credit or a special mention on their school record. This approach might motivate students to contribute to their communities while still respecting different personal situations. It also sends a clear message: what you do for others is valued, even if it is not the only way to measure success.\n\nQuestion: Choose the best heading (i–vi) for Paragraph A.",

Paragraph A: In recent years, many educators have suggested that community service should become part of school exams. They argue that helping in local projects – such as cleaning parks or visiting elderly people – teaches students empathy and responsibility. According to them, these qualities are just as important as mathematical or linguistic skills, and schools have a duty to encourage them.\n\nParagraph B: Opponents of this idea are worried about adding even more pressure to students’ lives. Young people already face heavy workloads and high expectations from parents and teachers. If volunteering becomes a requirement for passing exams, they fear that students will see it as just another obligation, not as a meaningful experience. In their view, community service should remain voluntary.\n\nParagraph C: Another concern is fairness. Some students live in areas where it is easy to find volunteering opportunities; others do not. In addition, not every teenager has the same amount of free time. Those who have to work after school or take care of younger siblings may not be able to complete the same number of hours as their classmates. Critics worry that mandatory community service could increase existing inequalities.\n\nParagraph D: A possible compromise is to include community service as an optional part of the assessment. For example, students who participate in approved projects could receive extra credit or a special mention on their school record. This approach might motivate students to contribute to their communities while still respecting different personal situations.
